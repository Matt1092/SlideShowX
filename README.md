# WallpaperUpdates
A program I made in C that regularly updates wallpapers on the desktop. I made this because I was bored of seeing the same desktop wallpaper so I automated this visual task through a simple program in C. This program prompts the user for the path of a file folder, loops through the files and applies a new wallpaper to the desktop.
Wallpapers only account for .png, .jpg, .jpeg and .btm files).
