# WallpaperUpdates
A program I made in C that regularly updates wallpapers on the desktop. I automated this visual task through a simple program in C. 
This program prompts the user for the path of a file folder, loops through the files forever and applies a new wallpaper to the desktop, until user presses escape key 'q'.
Wallpapers only account for .png, .jpg, .jpeg and .btm files).
